## description of my video
The story begins with a jump shot to close the distance to the characters. The camera focuses on the mobile phone in the protagonist's hand, which is filled with tickets to singer Jay Chou's concert. Then the protagonist puts on his headphones and opens his mobile phone music app to listen to Jay Chou's songs. 

The following scene expresses that Jay Chou's songs have always accompanied the protagonist, and that the protagonist has a deep affection for them. Scenes in the bedroom, library, and chair show that the protagonist listens to Jay Chou's songs wherever he goes. 

Then the sound of a heart beating faster foreshadows the upcoming concert and the nervousness in the protagonist's heart. The protagonist then watches the music video of Jay Chou's song and transitions to Jay Chou's concert. Another sound is used instead of Jay Chou's music, but the visual effect is retained. 

The story then transitions to a video of the concert recorded by the protagonist, indicating that the concert is over. The protagonist stands still, but the scene keeps changing, and then it transitions from the grass to the protagonist's bed. The covers are put on, and the head is covered, expressing the frustration that the protagonist feels after seeing the concert. The protagonist is still reeling from the beauty of the concert, but also frustrated that it is over and he won't be able to see his idol anymore. 

The story ends with the mobile phone in the protagonist's hand falling on the floor, and the falling mobile phone plays a video of Jay Chou's concert.
