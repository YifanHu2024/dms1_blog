## description

At the beginning, our group had planned to take photos of people, and I was assigned the role of an actor to pose in different scenes. However, we later realized that we couldn't proceed with this plan, so we decided to abandon the idea.

After that, we decided to focus on rocks as our subject and theme, and I provided some materials for the scenes. We created several storyboards by combining the rocks and different settings. I worked with the group to conceptualize how to move the camera and provided some ideas for the images. I also wrote some notes to help clarify the vision for our project.
